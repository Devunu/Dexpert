## üí° Why Dexpert?

Traditional web automation tools are often brittle, breaking with minor UI changes. LLM-only agents can hallucinate or struggle with precise, complex interactions. Dexpert aims to bridge this gap by:

1.  **Understanding, Not Just Seeing:** Instead of relying on fragile selectors, Dexpert first *understands* the structure of a webpage using its Accessibility Tree analysis (`analyze_page_structure`). This leads to more intelligent and adaptable interactions.
2.  **Unmatched Robustness:** The `Dexpert-id` injection technique provides stable element handles, dramatically reducing failures due to dynamic class names or minor layout shifts.
3.  **True Task Automation:** Tools like `process_list` go beyond simple scripting, enabling complex, stateful RPA workflows managed by the LLM.
4.  **Integrated Deep Research:** The Next-Gen Researcher isn't an afterthought; it's a core capability, allowing the agent to gather, process, and reason about information from diverse sources.
5.  **Resilience through Fallbacks:** With vision capabilities and detailed error-handling logic guided by sophisticated prompts, Dexpert can often self-correct and find alternative ways to achieve its goals.

**Dexpert is designed for users who need to automate complex, multi-step tasks that require a high degree of understanding, interaction, and information synthesis.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python 3.9+
*   An API Key for your chosen LLM provider (e.g., Google Gemini API Key).
*   Playwright browsers installed: `python -m playwright install --with-deps`

**Installation:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_Dexpert_REPO.git
    cd YOUR_Dexpert_REPO
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Configure API Keys:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root (copy from `.env.example` if provided).
    *   Add your API keys:
        ```env
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
        # NEWS_API_KEY="YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY" # Optional, for researcher
        # BRAVE_API_KEY="YOUR_BRAVE_API_KEY" # Optional, for researcher
        # SEARXNG_INSTANCE_URL="YOUR_SEARXNG_URL" # Optional, for researcher
        # ... other keys as needed
        ```
5.  **Review Configuration:**
    *   Check `config/settings.yaml` for default LLM models, browser paths (if not using Playwright's default), and other agent settings. Adjust if necessary. For example, you might need to set `browser_settings.browser_binary_path` if Playwright can't find your Chrome/Chromium.

**Running Dexpert:**

*   **CLI Mode:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    You will then be prompted to enter a task for Dexpert.

*   **(Future) Streamlit UI:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
    ```
    *(Note: Streamlit app functionality depends on its implementation, which was excluded from the provided content.)*

---

## üéÆ Example Usage

Once Dexpert is running in CLI mode, you can give it tasks like:

*   `"Go to Google Maps, search for 'pizza near me', and list the names and ratings of the first 5 results."`
*   `"Open my project 'my_app' in VS Code, then navigate to example.com, find the 'Login' button, and click it."`
*   `"Extract all job titles and company names from the first 3 pages of LinkedIn job search results for 'AI engineer remote'."` (This would leverage `extract_data` and potentially `process_list` for pagination if not handled by scrolling in `extract_data`).
*   `"Research the current market trends for electric vehicles, focusing on battery technology and charging infrastructure. Provide a detailed report."`
*   `"Go to the 2captcha demo page, attempt to solve the normal CAPTCHA, and tell me if you were successful."`
*   `"Please write a Python script that lists all .txt files in my Documents folder and saves the list to a file named 'doc_files.log' on my Desktop. Then execute this script."`

**(Add a screenshot of the CLI in action with a simple task)**

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Dexpert is an actively developing project with an ambitious vision. Here are some areas we're focusing on:

*   [ ] **Enhanced GUI:** Developing a user-friendly Streamlit (or other web framework) interface.
*   [ ] **More Robust Error Recovery:** Improving the LLM's ability to diagnose and recover from a wider range of failures.
*   [ ] **Advanced Self-Correction & Learning:** Implementing mechanisms for the agent to learn from past interactions and improve its strategies.
*   [ ] **Deeper Knowledge Graph Utilization:** Integrating KG insights more directly into the agent's reasoning and planning.
*   [ ] **Expanded Toolset:** Adding more tools for different applications (e.g., email interaction, calendar management, more specialized PC control).
*   [ ] **Multi-Agent Collaboration (Stretch Goal):** Enabling multiple Dexperts to work together on very large tasks.
*   [ ] **Sandboxed Execution Environments:** For safer execution of potentially untrusted scripts or browser interactions.
*   [ ] **Comprehensive Testing Suite:** Building out unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   [ ] **Simplified Onboarding & Deployment:** Making it easier for users to get started and deploy Dexpert.
